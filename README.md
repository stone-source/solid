# Practice and Learning Repository

This repository was created to help practice and understand different programming concepts. Here, I will upload code examples, exercises, and small projects that I work on while learning. It is a personal space for experiments and learning by doing.

The examples in this repo are simple and focused. They are not part of any big project. I may also include comments in the code to explain what I am doing and why.

If you are also learning and looking for practice materials, feel free to look around. You can use my code as a reference, try to improve it, or compare it with your own solutions. This repo will grow over time as I continue practicing and exploring new things.
